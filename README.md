I'm building a social media app. In this app you can login & signup you can also create your account and upload photos
and share it on your feed


Day 1 :- I've started with Backend, first i made a folder "SERVER" and installed all the required dependencies

NAME OF ALL DEPENDENCIES :- 
"Bcrypt"
"Body-parser"
"Cors"
"Dotenv
"Express"
"Gridfs-stream"
"Helmet"
"Jsonwebtoken"
"Mongoose"
"Morgan": "
"Multer": "
"Multer-gridfs-storage"

I also added "Type": "module" in the package.json file so that i can write in a import format instead of required
"IMPORT" is an ES6 feature ex:- IMPORT EXPRESS FROM "EXPRESS";
